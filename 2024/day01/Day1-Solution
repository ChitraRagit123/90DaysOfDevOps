What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and tools that aim to improve collaboration between development (Dev) and operations
(Ops) teams. It focuses on automating and integrating the processes of software development, testing, deployment, and monitoring
to deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently. DevOps fosters a culture of continuous integration and continuous 
deployment (CI/CD), enabling organizations to release updates faster, with fewer errors, and more reliability.


What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure?
Automation
Automation in DevOps refers to using tools and scripts to automate repetitive tasks such as code integration, testing, deployment, and infrastructure management. It reduces human intervention, minimizes errors, and increases efficiency.
Scaling
Scaling in DevOps refers to the ability to handle increasing workloads by adding (scaling out) or upgrading (scaling up) resources. It ensures that applications can handle more users and traffic efficiently.
Infrastructure
Infrastructure in DevOps refers to the hardware, networks, servers, and cloud services required to deploy and run applications.
