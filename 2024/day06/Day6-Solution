1.Understanding the file permissions
: ls -l file_name.txt(used to check the file permissions)
:-rwx--x--x
: here first - represent if it is a file(-) or directory(d)
- here first pair rwx represent permissions to owner(if - "no permission")
- here second pair rwx represent permissions to group(if - "no permission")
- here third pair rwx represent permissions to others(if - "no permission")
-example : drwx--x--x: this implies this are the permissions to a directory,owner has read,write,execute permission,userns in group have execute permission,and others have execute permission.
-chown ubuntu myfile.txt(ðŸ”¹ Changes the owner of myfile.txt to ubuntu.
                         ðŸ”¹ The group remains unchanged)
-sudo chgrp devops my-devops-file.txt(ðŸ”¹changes the group that can access the file)
     r   w   x
7    1   1   1    rwx
6    1   1   0    rw-
5    1   0   1    r-x
4    1   0   0    r--
3    0   1   1    -wx
2    0   1   0    -w-
1    0   0   1    --x
0    0   0   0    ---

-chmod 700 myfile.txt(here it give permission to owner -read,write,execute,
group ---,others ---)
