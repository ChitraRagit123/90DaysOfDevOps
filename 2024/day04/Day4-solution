1.Explain in your own words and with examples what Shell Scripting means for DevOps.
:- Shell scripting is a powerful automation tool used in DevOps to execute multiple Linux/Unix commands in a script file, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency across tasks. It is essential for automating deployments, configurations, monitoring, and infrastructure management.

2.What is #!/bin/bash? Can we write #!/bin/sh as well?
:- #!/bin/bash is called a shebang (#!), followed by the path to the Bash shell (/bin/bash). It tells the system to use Bash as the interpreter to execute the script.

3.Write a Shell Script that prints I will complete #90DaysOfDevOps challenge.
:-  vim 90daysofdevops.sh
    i
    write "I will complete #90DaysOfDevOps challenge
    esc+:+w+q

4.Write a Shell Script that takes user input, input from arguments, and prints the variables.
:- takes  user input
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Enter your name:"
    read name
    echo "Hello, $name!"
:- input from arguments
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Rank $1" (prints 1st argument while running the script)
:- prints the variables
    #!/bin/bash
    name="Chitra"
    echo "Hello, $name!"

5.Provide an example of an If-Else statement in Shell Scripting by comparing two numbers.
here i'm taking an example which takes input numbers from user and compare them:
    echo "Enter 1st number:"
    read first
    echo "1st number: $first!"

    echo "Enter 2nd number:"
    read second
    echo "2nd number: $second!"

    if [ "$first" -gt "$second" ]; then
      echo "$first is greater than $second"
    elif [ "$first" -lt "$second" ]; then
      echo "$first is less than $second"
    else
      echo "Both numbers are equal"
    fi
