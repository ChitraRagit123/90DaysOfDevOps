Cron and Crontab Explained
1. Cron (Command Run On)
-Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems.
-It allows users to automate repetitive tasks by scheduling commands or 
 scripts to run at specified intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, or every 
 minute).
-The cron daemon (crond) runs in the background and executes scheduled jobs.
2. Crontab (Cron Table)
-Crontab is a configuration file that contains cron jobs for a specific user.
-Each user can have their own crontab file to define scheduled tasks.
-The crontab command is used to edit, list, or remove cron jobs.

Crontab Syntax
A crontab entry follows this format:
MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW COMMAND
MIN → Minute (0-59)
HOUR → Hour (0-23)
DOM → Day of the Month (1-31)
MON → Month (1-12)
DOW → Day of the Week (0-6, where 0 = Sunday)
COMMAND → The script or command to run

Examples of Crontab Jobs
1️⃣ Run a script every day at 5 AM
0 5 * * * /path/to/script.sh


2.Create a Script to Backup All Your Work:
in /home/ubuntu
-touch backup.log(as cron job runs in background we can't find error if it runs wrong, therefore we are using log  file)
-mkdir backups(here latest 5 backups will be stored)
-mkdir backupScripts(store the backup_script.sh)
-cd backupScripts
-vim backup_script.sh
-i
-BACKUP_SCRIPT STARTS
#!/bin/bash

# Define source and target directories
src_dir="/home/ubuntu/src_dir/createDirectories.sh"
target_dir="/home/ubuntu/backups"

# Ensure the target directory exists
mkdir -p "$target_dir"

# Generate a timestamp for the backup file
timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")

# Create a zip backup
backup_file="${target_dir}/backup_${timestamp}.zip"
zip -r "$backup_file" "$src_dir" > /dev/null
# Print success message
echo "Backup created: $backup_file"

# Keep only the last 5 backups and delete older ones
cd "$target_dir" || exit
ls -t backup_*.zip | tail -n +6 | xargs rm -f

echo "Old backups removed. Only the latest 5 are retained."

-BACKUP_SCRIPT_ENDS
-esc+:+w+q

#now got to crontab and add a cronjob to mrun the script automatically and store latest 5 backups of a particular file
-crontab -e
CRONJOB STARTS
* * * * * /bin/bash /home/ubuntu/backupScripts/backup_scripts.sh >> /home/ubuntu/backup.log 2>&1
CROBJOB ENDS
#this cronjob will run every minute evey hour,every day of the week,every month,every day
